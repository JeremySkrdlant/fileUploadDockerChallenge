# Docker File Upload Challenge 

## Goals 
* Create the Docker files for the backend
* Create a docker network that consists of the angular app and the express backend.
* Create a volume that points to the uploads image folder

### Above and beyond (extra credit)
* Create a new route in express that lists all the image file names
* Fetch that route and display those images on the Angular Page.
* Have it all work in Docker.

## Starting the project 

You will want to clone the project first.
